# BlueWebsightTracker

## Background
The Blue Websight (https://websight.blue/) is a web forum of an internet subculture that has had many iterations over the past 25 years (GameFAQs forums to Luelinks to End of the Internet to its current location). The community has always had a very private attitude which has gotten more severe over time. As such, recruitment to the community has slowly changed from welcome, to looked down upon, and finally made impossible. This lack of recruitment also means that the community is ultimately moribund due to a slowly dwindling userbase which this project aims to track.

## Data
This project is made possible by publicly available aggregate metrics provided by the Blue Websight. It tracks the total posts users make with data starting on April 19, 2024. This data is presumed to show a declining trend. It is presented to study the decline of such a long lasting subculture and understand how long it can survive under such conditions.

## Risks
It should be noted that while this community can be seen as typical, juvenile, largely young male web forum in its beginnings, it has developed several cult-like qualities in its isolation:
- Abuse of its own members (harassment, doxxing, threats of violence)
- Shunning of ex-members, contact of whom is forbidden of current members
- An 'us-vs-them' mindset where anyone who threatens their isolation is attacked

We understand that studying such a community, openly and dependent on data that they provide is inherently risky. This project may ultimately be doomed if this data is manipulated or if access is revoked. That being said, we are hopeful that this project can help influence current users to see that their community is approaching its end not due to outside influence but due to internal decay and to find the strength to healthily step away.

Other than the tracking of metrics, we do not make, nor do we encourage, any deliberate contact with this community.
